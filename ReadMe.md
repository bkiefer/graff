# graff - A library for directed graphs and graph algorithms

This library contains a polished version of a graph implementation that emerged
from teaching Java at the University of Saarland. To support the graph
algorithms efficiently, there are some implementations of not-so-common data
structures like Fibonacci heaps, Partition (Union-Find) data structures,
bidirectional ID maps.

Finally, there is code to handle finite state automata, based on the graph library.

## Graph algorithms:

- Depth/Breadth first search
- topological order
- Dijkstra shortest path
- Strongly Connected Components graph reduction
- Transitive Closure
- Transitive Reduction

## Finite State Automata algorithms

- Determinization
- Minimization (Hopcroft)
- Minimization (Brzowski)
